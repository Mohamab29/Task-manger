## :dart: About ##

Task Manger website is the first project in my full-stack course and the purpose of it is to use all the things we learned about front-end design in a web page using HTML,CSS3 and JavaScript.

In the website a user can enter to do tasks in the task board , after that a yellow card will be automatically shown with the all the task text in it and also the date and time at the moment it was written, and if a user is done with a task he can simply delete it,and of course he can as many tasks as he wants .

Since this is just a front-end design the website will not have any back-end development in it
, instead the tasks will be saved locally on the user's local machine using Local Storage .
